- "CodeOriginal" is the code that was given to me with the goal of writing a more generalizable version.

- "CondensedCode" is the more generalizable version of "CodeOriginal" that I wrote in leading a team of undergraduates.

- "CondensedCodeOutput" is a presentation that I made displaying the output and results of "condensed code."

- "MeditationRetreatData" is a presentation that I made showing the results from EEG data I analyzed using Brain Vision Analyzer.
